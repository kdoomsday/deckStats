deckStats
=========

Application for obtaining stats about MTG decks.
By default it uses an H2 database to store the cards, and it can download card information on it's
own using different methods. It can also, however, retrieve the card data from an xml file.

TODO
----

- Check for compatibility with the new xml format Cockatrice uses.
- Display the loaded deck.
- Allow displaying of cards.
